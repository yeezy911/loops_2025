# Example Practice:
# Given this list of fruits:
from operator import index


fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

print(len(fruits))
# Challenge:
# Use a for loop to print each fruit on a new line.
print(fruits[0])
print(fruits[1])
print(fruits[2])
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
# i just worked with loops

# Given a list of school subjects:
subjects = ["Math", "Science", "History", "Art"]
for subject in subjects:

# print out each subject but stop when you reach "History
for subject in subjects:

        break
    print(subject)
# skip over "Science" and print the rest
for subject in subjects:

# # Challenge:
# # Use a for loop and range to print each subject along with its index:
# # Example output: "Subject 0: Math"

#     print("Subject " + str(index) + ": " + subjects(index))

# # Given:
numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]

# # Use a for loop to add all the numbers and print the total.
